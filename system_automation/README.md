## 📌 Project Overview
This initiative focuses on the automation of critical Linux system administration tasks using Bash shell scripting. It eliminates manual intervention, reduces operational risks, and enhances system reliability through modular, scalable, and secure scripting solutions.

Each script addresses a specific administrative concern such as disk usage, user management, backups, service monitoring, performance logging, system health, and security assessments. All modules are governed via a master orchestration script and scheduled with `cron` for hands-free execution.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone or move project to: `/opt/system_automation`
2. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
  ``` cd /opt/system_automation/scripts```
3. Make all scripts executable:
`chmod +x *.sh`
4. Open crontab to schedule tasks:
`crontab -e`
Example entry:
0 * * * * /opt/system_automation/scripts/master_script.sh >> /var/log/sys_auto.log 2>&1
