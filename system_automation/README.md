System Automation Suite - Linux Shell Scripting Project
📌 Project Overview
The System Automation Suite is a collection of modular, production-ready Bash scripts designed to automate critical system administration tasks in a Linux environment. This suite is engineered to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual interventions, and streamline routine sysadmin processes such as disk monitoring, backup, log rotation, and security auditing.
